{"text": "Hypomethylation of L1RE1 is frequent in tumors compared to benign controls and associates with higher grade, whereas increasing methylation of RARB is an independent marker for tumors and higher grade. RASSF1 hypermethylation was frequent in tumors and most prominent in NET making it an auxiliary marker for separation of NSCLC and NET. L1RE1 in combination with either RARB or RASSF1 could function as biomarkers for separating lung cancer and non-cancerous tissue and could be useful for samples of limited size such as biopsies.", "denotations": [{"id": "T1", "obj": "disease", "span": {"begin": 40, "end": 46}}, {"id": "T2", "obj": "gene", "span": {"begin": 202, "end": 208}}, {"id": "T3", "obj": "disease", "span": {"begin": 271, "end": 274}}, {"id": "T4", "obj": "disease", "span": {"begin": 323, "end": 328}}, {"id": "T5", "obj": "disease", "span": {"begin": 430, "end": 441}}]}
