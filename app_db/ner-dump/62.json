{"text": "Based on this study, we propose the following algorithm, which, in the appropriate clinical and histological context, may be useful in establishing the correct diagnosis of SCLC: First, INSM1 detection is performed, and if the result is negative, CD56 is added, followed successively by p16 and TTF1, if all previously applied markers are negative. This approach should detect most, if not all, SCLC cases, while successively trading specificity for sensitivity.", "denotations": [{"id": "T1", "obj": "disease", "span": {"begin": 173, "end": 177}}, {"id": "T2", "obj": "gene", "span": {"begin": 186, "end": 191}}, {"id": "T3", "obj": "gene", "span": {"begin": 247, "end": 251}}, {"id": "T4", "obj": "gene", "span": {"begin": 287, "end": 290}}, {"id": "T5", "obj": "gene", "span": {"begin": 295, "end": 299}}]}
