Our results indicate that PRAL might be a tumor suppressor in lung cancer and thus provides novel clues for the diagnosis and treatment for lung cancer in clinical practice.", "denotations": [{"id": "T1", "obj": "gene", "span": {"begin": 24, "end": 28}}, {"id": "T2", "obj": "disease", "span": {"begin": 46, "end": 57}}, {"id": "T3", "obj": "gene", "span": {"begin": 166, "end": 169}}, {"id": "T4", "obj": "disease", "span": {"begin": 213, "end": 218}}]}
