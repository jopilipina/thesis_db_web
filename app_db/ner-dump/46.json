{"text": "The present study provides strong evidence that the bcl-2 gene has a suppressive function over genes involved in both angiogenesis (VEGF and TP) and cell migration (c-erbB-2) in NSCLC. TP and c-erbB-2 proteins are significantly, and often simultaneously, expressed in bcl-2 negative cases. However, expression of the c-erbB-2 abolishes the TP-related angiogenic activity. Whether this is a result of a direct activity of the c-erbB-2 protein or a consequence of a c-erbB-2-related immune response remains to be further investigated.", "denotations": [{"id": "T1", "obj": "gene", "span": {"begin": 52, "end": 57}}, {"id": "T2", "obj": "gene", "span": {"begin": 132, "end": 136}}, {"id": "T3", "obj": "gene", "span": {"begin": 141, "end": 143}}, {"id": "T4", "obj": "gene", "span": {"begin": 165, "end": 173}}, {"id": "T5", "obj": "disease", "span": {"begin": 178, "end": 183}}]}
