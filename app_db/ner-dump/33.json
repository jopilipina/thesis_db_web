Overexpression of thymidine phosphorylase (TP) reverts platinum-induced cancer cell death. We concluded that enhancement of the cytotoxicity to CDDP by coadminstration with DMC was mediated by down-regulation of the expression of TP and ERCC1, regulated by PI3K-Akt-Snail pathway inactivation.", "denotations": [{"id": "T1", "obj": "gene", "span": {"begin": 39, "end": 44}}, {"id": "T2", "obj": "gene", "span": {"begin": 175, "end": 198}}, {"id": "T3", "obj": "gene", "span": {"begin": 200, "end": 202}}, {"id": "T4", "obj": "gene", "span": {"begin": 414, "end": 428}}]}
