{"text": "We found that melatonin downregulated EMT by inhibiting Twist/Twist1 (twist family bHLH transcription factor 1) expression. This effect was mediated by MT1 receptor, PLC, p38/ERK and b-catenin signaling cascades. Twist expression was positively correlated with tumor stage and negatively correlated with MT1 expression in lung cancer specimens. Furthermore, melatonin inhibited EMT marker expression and lung cancer metastasis to liver in vivo Finally, melatonin shows promise in the treatment of lung cancer metastasis and deserves further study.", "denotations": [{"id": "T1", "obj": "gene", "span": {"begin": 14, "end": 23}}, {"id": "T2", "obj": "gene", "span": {"begin": 38, "end": 41}}, {"id": "T3", "obj": "gene", "span": {"begin": 83, "end": 110}}, {"id": "T4", "obj": "gene", "span": {"begin": 152, "end": 164}}, {"id": "T5", "obj": "gene", "span": {"begin": 166, "end": 169}}, {"id": "T6", "obj": "gene", "span": {"begin": 213, "end": 218}}, {"id": "T7", "obj": "disease", "span": {"begin": 261, "end": 266}}, {"id": "T8", "obj": "gene", "span": {"begin": 304, "end": 307}}, {"id": "T9", "obj": "disease", "span": {"begin": 322, "end": 343}}, {"id": "T10", "obj": "disease", "span": {"begin": 404, "end": 415}}]}
