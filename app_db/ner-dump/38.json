{"text": "miR-140-3p negatively affected the tumorigenesis of SqCLC by down-regulating the expression of BRD9, an oncogene in SqCLC. Inhibition of BRD9 repressed SqCLC tumorigenesis by regulating c-myc expression. Meanwhile, BRD9 expression is up-regulated and negatively correlated with miR-140-3p in clinical samples; a meta-analysis of survival data indicates that SqCLC patients with high levels of BRD9 in their tumors have a worse prognosis.
