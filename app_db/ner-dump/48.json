{"text": "Overexpression of MYC could reverse the inhibition of MYC targets by RIF1 knockdown. Taken together, these data revealed that RIF1 played an important role in regulating MYC and MYC-activated genes, which in turn contributes to cellular response to cisplatin and NSCLC patients' response to platinum-based chemotherapy. RIF1 might serve as a novel biomarker for predicting platinum-based chemo-sensitivity and the prognosis of NSCLC patients, so as to guide the chemotherapy regimen adjustment for individual patient with NSCLC and improve their clinical outcomes.", "denotations": [{"id": "T1", "obj": "gene", "span": {"begin": 18, "end": 21}}, {"id": "T2", "obj": "gene", "span": {"begin": 69, "end": 73}}, {"id": "T3", "obj": "disease", "span": {"begin": 263, "end": 277}}, {"id": "T4", "obj": "disease", "span": {"begin": 522, "end": 527}}]}
