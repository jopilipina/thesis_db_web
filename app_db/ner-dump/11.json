{"text": "The results of this comprehensive study show both microbiome-gene and microbiome-exposure interactions in squamous cell carcinoma lung cancer tissue. Specifically, tumors harboring TP53 mutations, which can impair epithelial function, have a unique bacterial consortium that is higher in relative abundance in smoking-associated tumors of this type. Given the significant need for clinical diagnostic tools in lung cancer, this study may provide novel biomarkers for early detection.", "denotations": [{"id": "T1", "obj": "disease", "span": {"begin": 164, "end": 170}}, {"id": "T2", "obj": "gene", "span": {"begin": 181, "end": 185}}, {"id": "T3", "obj": "disease", "span": {"begin": 410, "end": 421}}]}
