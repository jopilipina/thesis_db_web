{"text": "Conclusion: This is the first report of immunocytochemistry of a panel of markers on cells exfoliated in sputum samples which suggests that analysis of immunocytochemical markers in sputum samples can be attempted as a cost-effective and reliable predictor of prognosis and survival. Accumulation of mutated p53, overexpression of galectin-3, and lower expression of p16 and EGFR proteins were found to predict poor prognosis for lung cancer.", "denotations": [{"id": "T1", "obj": "disease", "span": {"begin": 182, "end": 196}}, {"id": "T2", "obj": "gene", "span": {"begin": 308, "end": 311}}, {"id": "T3", "obj": "gene", "span": {"begin": 331, "end": 341}}, {"id": "T4", "obj": "gene", "span": {"begin": 367, "end": 370}}, {"id": "T5", "obj": "gene", "span": {"begin": 375, "end": 379}}, {"id": "T6", "obj": "disease", "span": {"begin": 430, "end": 441}}]}
