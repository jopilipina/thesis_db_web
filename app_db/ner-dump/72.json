Further, it would help in understanding the mechanistic aspects of the diseased state which may facilitate in designing of new therapeutic modalities that could help in cancer management.", "denotations": [{"id": "T1", "obj": "gene", "span": {"begin": 56, "end": 67}}, {"id": "T2", "obj": "gene", "span": {"begin": 86, "end": 90}}, {"id": "T3", "obj": "disease", "span": {"begin": 368, "end": 374}}]}
