{"text": "Programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression on lung cancer cells is a prognostic marker and a predictive biomarker for response to immunotherapy. The study demonstrated that the clinical characteristics of patients with PD-L1 expression may differ from those of patients with PD-L2 expression, and that both might contribute to poor prognoses. The potential role of PD-L2 expression as a predictive biomarker for response to immunotherapy should be investigated in future studies.", "denotations": [{"id": "T1", "obj": "gene", "span": {"begin": 27, "end": 32}}, {"id": "T2", "obj": "gene", "span": {"begin": 277, "end": 282}}]}
