{"text": "Radiotherapy enhances responses of lung cancer to CTLA-4 blockade. The report provides important human qualification of pre-clinical mechanistic insights indicating that abscopal responses can be generated with optimised radiotherapy fractionation schedules and anti-CTLA-4 inhibition. Additionally, an intriguing mechanism by which radiation can be immunogenic is described, namely radiation-induced transcriptional upregulation of neo-antigens.", "denotations": [{"id": "T1", "obj": "disease", "span": {"begin": 35, "end": 46}}, {"id": "T2", "obj": "gene", "span": {"begin": 50, "end": 56}}]}
