{"text": "The present study demonstrated that FHIT loss may be important in the occurrence of lung cancer, particularly in lung SCCs. FHIT loss may therefore be used as an early indicator for lung cancer, particularly for patients with a history of smoking. HPV infection in lung tumorigenesis may, at least in part, be mediated through FHIT loss. FHIT loss and p53 mutation may coordinate together in the development of HPV-associated lung cancer, and accelerate the occurrence and development of lung cancer.", "denotations": [{"id": "T1", "obj": "gene", "span": {"begin": 36, "end": 40}}, {"id": "T2", "obj": "disease", "span": {"begin": 84, "end": 95}}, {"id": "T3", "obj": "disease", "span": {"begin": 113, "end": 122}}, {"id": "T4", "obj": "gene", "span": {"begin": 352, "end": 355}}, {"id": "T5", "obj": "disease", "span": {"begin": 411, "end": 437}}]}
