{"text": "In conclusion, our study showed that combination of BCL2 inhibitor with HSP90 inhibitor increased activity in in vitro and in vivo study in only BCL-2 expressing SCLC compared to either single BCL2 inhibitor or HSP inhibitor. The enhanced activity might be led by blocking several apoptotic pathways simultaneously rather than a specific pathway.", "denotations": [{"id": "T1", "obj": "gene", "span": {"begin": 52, "end": 56}}, {"id": "T2", "obj": "gene", "span": {"begin": 72, "end": 77}}, {"id": "T3", "obj": "gene", "span": {"begin": 145, "end": 150}}, {"id": "T4", "obj": "disease", "span": {"begin": 162, "end": 166}}, {"id": "T5", "obj": "gene", "span": {"begin": 211, "end": 214}}]}
