{"text": "Our results showed that 7 hypermethylated genes (including CDKN2A, RASSF1, MGMT, RARB, DAPK, WIF1 and FHIT) were significantly associated with the smoking behavior in NSCLC patients. The further population-based subgroup meta-analyses showed that the CDKN2A hypermethylation was significantly associated with cigarette smoking in Japanese, Chinese and Americans. In contrast, a significant association of RARB hypermethylation and smoking behavior was only detected in Chinese but not in Japanese. The genes with altered DNA methylation were likely to be potentially useful biomarkers in the early diagnosis of NSCLC.", "denotations": [{"id": "T1", "obj": "gene", "span": {"begin": 59, "end": 65}}, {"id": "T2", "obj": "gene", "span": {"begin": 67, "end": 73}}, {"id": "T3", "obj": "gene", "span": {"begin": 75, "end": 79}}, {"id": "T4", "obj": "gene", "span": {"begin": 81, "end": 85}}, {"id": "T5", "obj": "gene", "span": {"begin": 87, "end": 91}}, {"id": "T6", "obj": "gene", "span": {"begin": 93, "end": 97}}, {"id": "T7", "obj": "gene", "span": {"begin": 102, "end": 106}}, {"id": "T8", "obj": "disease", "span": {"begin": 167, "end": 181}}, {"id": "T9", "obj": "disease", "span": {"begin": 405, "end": 409}}, {"id": "T10", "obj": "disease", "span": {"begin": 611, "end": 616}}]}
