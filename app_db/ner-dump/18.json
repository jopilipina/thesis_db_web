{"text": "We also identified the expression level of SGK1 and the p53 pathway including downstream apoptotic proteins under the stimulation of \u03b3-radiation and SGK1 inhibitor GSK650394, which presented a series of dynamic fluctuations. Our results suggest that SGK1 dynamics could play an important role in cell signaling, which is capable of directly influencing NSCLC cellular fate decisions.", "denotations": [{"id": "T1", "obj": "gene", "span": {"begin": 43, "end": 47}}, {"id": "T2", "obj": "gene", "span": {"begin": 56, "end": 59}}, {"id": "T3", "obj": "gene", "span": {"begin": 133, "end": 144}}, {"id": "T4", "obj": "gene", "span": {"begin": 164, "end": 173}}]}
