RASSF1 hypermethylation was frequent in tumors and most prominent in NET making it an auxiliary marker for separation of NSCLC and NET. L1RE1 in combination with either RARB or RASSF1 could function as biomarkers for separating lung cancer and non-cancerous tissue and could be useful for samples of limited size such as biopsies.

Excision repair cross-complementary 1 (ERCC1) overexpression in lung cancer cells is strongly correlated with its resistance to platinum-based chemotherapy. Overexpression of thymidine phosphorylase (TP) reverts platinum-induced cancer cell death. We concluded that enhancement of the cytotoxicity to CDDP by coadminstration with DMC was mediated by down-regulation of the expression of TP and ERCC1, regulated by PI3K-Akt-Snail pathway inactivation.

TEST
miR-140-3p negatively affected the tumorigenesis of SqCLC by down-regulating the expression of BRD9, an oncogene in SqCLC. Inhibition of BRD9 repressed SqCLC tumorigenesis by regulating c-myc expression. Meanwhile, BRD9 expression is up-regulated and negatively correlated with miR-140-3p in clinical samples; a meta-analysis of survival data indicates that SqCLC patients with high levels of BRD9 in their tumors have a worse prognosis.

TEST
Our results showed that 7 hypermethylated genes (including CDKN2A, RASSF1, MGMT, RARB, DAPK, WIF1 and FHIT) were significantly associated with the smoking behavior in NSCLC patients. The further population-based subgroup meta-analyses showed that the CDKN2A hypermethylation was significantly associated with cigarette smoking in Japanese, Chinese and Americans. In contrast, a significant association of RARB hypermethylation and smoking behavior was only detected in Chinese but not in Japanese. The genes with altered DNA methylation were likely to be potentially useful biomarkers in the early diagnosis of NSCLC.
TEST
The present study demonstrated that FHIT loss may be important in the occurrence of lung cancer, particularly in lung SCCs. FHIT loss may therefore be used as an early indicator for lung cancer, particularly for patients with a history of smoking. HPV infection in lung tumorigenesis may, at least in part, be mediated through FHIT loss. FHIT loss and p53 mutation may coordinate together in the development of HPV-associated lung cancer, and accelerate the occurrence and development of lung cancer.
TEST
The results of this meta-analysis suggest that FHIT hypermethylation is associated with an increased risk and worsen survival in NSCLC patients. FHIT hypermethylation, which induces the inactivation of FHIT gene, plays an important role in the carcinogenesis and clinical outcome and may serve as a potential drug target of NSCLC.
TEST
The present study provides strong evidence that the bcl-2 gene has a suppressive function over genes involved in both angiogenesis (VEGF and TP) and cell migration (c-erbB-2) in NSCLC. TP and c-erbB-2 proteins are significantly, and often simultaneously, expressed in bcl-2 negative cases. However, expression of the c-erbB-2 abolishes the TP-related angiogenic activity. Whether this is a result of a direct activity of the c-erbB-2 protein or a consequence of a c-erbB-2-related immune response remains to be further investigated.

Based on this study, we propose the following algorithm, which, in the appropriate clinical and histological context, may be useful in establishing the correct diagnosis of SCLC: First, INSM1 detection is performed, and if the result is negative, CD56 is added, followed successively by p16 and TTF1, if all previously applied markers are negative. This approach should detect most, if not all, SCLC cases, while successively trading specificity for sensitivity.
